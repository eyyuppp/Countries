# Countries
kotlin with countries
Countries

I developed this application with kotlin language.
The aim is to learn about countries. For example, you can learn the country's flag, currency, region, capital and language through this application.



**Major technologies**

* MVVM
* RxJava(I pulled data using single class)
* Room(I used three annotations to save: Insert, delete, Query)
* Retrofit(ı used Gson to convert variable)
* Live data(I used three live data variables. These are the variable that holds the error, loading and data)
* Navigation companent(For a powerful application, it is necessary to use navigation. Single activity, multiple fragments.)
* Coroutine(I used it for data operations. to save data to local database)
* Data binding(i used databinding to take up less space.This way is very efficent)
* Shared preference(If you want to save the data, you can use the shared preference. I used this to save time. if time is greater than 10 I will get data from room database. Otherwise I will get it using api)
* Glide(I used glide to load the images. If the upload is "loading", it will be "circular bar". If "error", the wrong image will be shown.)
